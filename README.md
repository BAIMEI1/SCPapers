# Must-read papers on Sememe Computation

Contributed by [Fanchao Qi](https://github.com/Fanchao-Qi).

## Introduction

Sememes are defined as the minimum indivisible semantic units of meaning. Some people believe that semantic meanings of all the concepts including words can be composed of a limited closed set of sememes. 

As a result, sememes can help us comprehend human languages better. In fact, some works have proved that some neural NLP models perform better with incorporation of sememe knowledge.

[HowNet](http://www.keenage.com/), initially published in 2000, is the most famous sememe-based linguistic knowledge base.
